In the `CPC_audio` folder there is a snapshot of our <https://github.com/chorowski-lab/CPC_audio>, which also uses parts or full repos: <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CPC_audio>, <https://github.com/facebookresearch/CPC_audio/tree/zerospeech>, <https://github.com/tuanh208/CPC_audio/tree/zerospeech>,  <https://github.com/bootphon/zerospeech2021_baseline>. For more details see `CPC_audio` folder and `CPC_audio/README.md`.

The code in this folder has been used for:
  - producing nullspace-based embeddings
     - the code from the `CPC_audio` folder has been used for nullspace technique; please see `CPC_audio/README.md` for the description (in the "Nullspaces" subsection). Additionally to check phoneme separability for the nullspaces, `CPC_audio/finetune_nullspace.sh` was used.
  - producing clustering in the nullspace
    - Code from `CPC_audio` folder has been used for clustering and quantization. `CPC_audio/cpc/criterion/clustering/clustering_script.py` script from there has been used for computing the k-means clustering based on cosine lengths - embeddings and cluster centers were normalized for computing distances, and resulting clusters were normalized too (see `cluster_cosine.sh` script in this folder). For cluster assignment, `CPC_audio/scripts/quantize_audio.py` has been used, also with normalizing lengths of embeddings for cosine-distance-based assignment (see `cosine_quant_assign_cosine...` scripts in this folder). For basline quantizations we also used `CPC_audio/scripts/quantize_audio.py` (taken from zerospeech2021_baseline repo).
  - performing pushing embeddings to closest centers 
    - `closestpushCelan.py` script from this folder were used to compute "pushed" representations. On top of embeddings, we use the centers of the obtained clusters, and we move each embedding a part of the distance (e.g. half) in the direction of the closest clusterâ€™s center. This aims to include information about the whole dataset coming from clustering without substantial loss of local information, as a kind of denoising. (`nullCosSpCosClean.sh` and similar scripts in this folder that were used to do this and evaluate ABX; we were pushing a chosen part of euclidean distance for various euclidean/cosine k-means clustering and euclidean/cosine closest cluster choice combinations; additionally `noNullPushClean.sh` operates on original embeddings without the nullspace technique and `nullCosSpCosCleanNormPush.sh` normalizes embeddings before pushing which better approximates pushing a part of cosine and not euclidean distance, but results were similar after tuning). Additionally, `CPC_audio/centerpush...phoneme_classification.sh` scripts were used for phoneme separability experiment with center-pushing.
    
Additionally, cluster centers distance matrix to use for sWUGGY task was made (see `dist_matrix_from_clusters.py`).

It is also worth mentioning that we found out the following workflow improved the results:
 - compute representations for the whole LibriSpeech-dev/test dataset
 - remove extra files
 - compute other things on top of those
in comparison to computing features for datasets used for ZeroSpeech phonetic metric evaluation. This can perhaps be because audio data in LibriSpeech is (at least sometimes) consecutive and removing parts of it (some files, as in ZeroSpeech ABX-evaluation dataset) may harm autoregressive context (as `zerospeech2021_baseline/scripts/build_CPC_features.py` script we used for building features keeps autoregressive context between files as default, so removing some consecutive-audio files was perhaps making high-level features out-of-date (by some files))



## How to reproduce:

Names written in capital letters are to be changed to user-specific when executing this


### Reproducing baseline ABX with workflow described in the submission paper:

1. Install `zeroseppech2021_baseline` with the environment and download checkpoints as described in its readme
2. Run:
```
reproduce_baseline_ABX.sh ZEROSPEECH2021_BASELINE_PATH LIBRISPEECH_PATH ZEROSPEECH_DATASET_PATH SAVE_DIR
```

This will leave produced embeddings under `SAVE_DIR/reproduce_baseline_ABX_submission/phonetic`.


### Performing k-means clustering on nullspace embeddings and producing quantizations:

1. Install CPC_audio with the environment (version under `CPC_audio` folder here) and soundfile with pip instead of conda one and activate it
2. For cosine k-means clustering and cosine-closest assignment quantizations run:
  ```
  cluster_nullspace_cosine_and_quantize.sh LIBRISPEECH_PATH flac ZEROSPEECH_DATASET_PATH wav SAVE_DIR NULLSPACE_MODEL_NO_CLUSTERING_CHECKPOINT_PATH
  ```
  For euclidean k-means clustering and euclidean-closest assignment quantizations run:
  ```
  cluster_nullspace_cosine_and_quantize.sh LIBRISPEECH_PATH flac ZEROSPEECH_DATASET_PATH wav SAVE_DIR NULLSPACE_MODEL_NO_CLUSTERING_CHECKPOINT_PATH
  ```



### Baseline quantization

1. Install CPC_audio with the environment (version under `CPC_audio` folder here) and soundfile with pip instead of conda one and activate it
2. Run:
  ```
  quantize_baseline.sh LIBRISPEECH_PATH flac ZEROSPEECH_DATASET_PATH wav SAVE_DIR BASELINE_KMEANS50BIG_CHECKPOINT_PATH
  ```



### Center-pushing for ABX

1. Install and activate `zerospeech2021` environment
2. For chosen configuration (see examples below), run:
```
push_and_eval_embeddings.sh \
