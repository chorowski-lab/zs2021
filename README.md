This is the repository that contains code we used for University of Wroclaw ZeroSpeech 2021 submission and realted paper.

Directories under here contain code for different tasks with descriptions how to reproduce the results. Additionally, `abx,clustering,quantization` also provides how to reproduse quantizations used in other tasks (and distance matrices for sWUGGY).
